Included here is a prototype layout for a controller circuit.

The Controller_v4 is different from the previous versions and 
requires a different firmware than the other versions.

New features are:
-----------------
Support for 3 bipolar Steppers using A4988 Polulu driver modules.
Support for 1 unipolar Stepper using a ULN2003
Support for 1 Servo 
Support for 3 GPIO outputs 500mA
Support for 1 high load output (5A)
Support for 2 signal inputs
